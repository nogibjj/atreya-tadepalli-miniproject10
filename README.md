### Mini Project 10 - Pyspark Usage

## Introduction

In this project, I worked on harnessing PySpark to execute SQL operations. In this project, I reviewed records associated with health failure, including blood pressure status, creatinine levels, and smoking habits, to better understand biological indicators of heart failure, segmented by age.

## Steps




1. First thing to do on launch is to open a new shell and verify virtualenv is sourced.

Things included are:

* `Makefile`

* `Pytest`

* `pandas`

* `Ruff`:  

Run `make lint` which runs `ruff check`.  You can find out more info on [Ruff here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

* `Dockerfile`

* `GitHub copilot`

* `jupyter` and `ipython` 

* A base set of libraries for devops and web

* `githubactions`
